/**
 * Cross-boundary flag tracking whether a live [ClusterMainSession] currently holds the
 * Templates Host binding. MainActivity cannot directly query the out-of-process
 * CarAppActivity session, so this shared object substitutes for that lookup.
 *
 * Writes (ClusterMainSession):
 * - `true` in onCreateScreen when a session starts.
 * - `false` in the session's onDestroy observer, but only for the *primary* session AND only
 *   when it is still the current primary (a superseded late teardown leaves the flag alone;
 *   secondary sessions never touch it).
 *
 * Writes (MainActivity.restartClusterBinding):
 * - `false` immediately after finishing the CarAppActivity task, so a delayed/absent onDestroy
 *   can't leave the flag stuck `true` and deadlock the relaunch guard below.
 *
 * Reads (MainActivity.launchCarAppActivity):
 * - If `true`, the launch is deferred and retried after 4s, preventing a second
 *   CarAppActivity from being started while the Host is still tearing down the old
 *   session (which would cause the Host to reject the new bind).
 *
 * @Volatile: onDestroy can be dispatched from a Host-owned thread, so the MainActivity
 * UI-thread read must see the write without CPU-cache staleness.
